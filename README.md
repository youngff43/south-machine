## Project Description 
A program built to generate a webpage that displays a team's basic information that allows quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles. The user runs node index in the command line of their terminal and a series of questions appear that accept input. They will be promoted to to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number. The user wil then be presented with a menu with the option to add more members of the team or finish and build the website. If they choose to add more members they will then be taken to a menu asking if they want to add an engineer or an intern. If the user selects the engineer option they will be prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and then return to the menu asking if they want to add more team members. If the the intern option is selected the user will be prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school. The user is able to add as many team members as they want. Once the user finishes and selects the "create team" option a HTML file is generated that displays the formatted team roster. If the user clicks on a email address on one of the employee cards their default email program opens and populates the 'To' field of the email with the address. If the user clicks on the GitHub username they will be taken to that GitHub profile in a new tab.
